**There is some ambiguity in the acceptance criteria. The precise objective for ordering 20% higher than minimum required food is not clear.

As per the languange of the AC, the objective is to **'Order 20% more than needed to feed the dogs'**
In the example provided i.e. S = 5, M=3, L 7, Remaining Food =17lbs, the minimum food required is 5 *10 +3 *20 +7*30 = 320 lbs

Scenario 1:
If we need to ensure we have **food stock** '20% more than needed,'then the total food requirement is 320*1.2 = 384
In this case the order quantity should be 384-17 = 367lbs

Scenario 2:
If we need to ensure we have **order quantity** '20% more than needed,' then the order quantity should be 1.2*(320-17) = 363.6lbs 

We potentially need to clarify with the product owner regarding what is the true objective/requirement, and proceed with dveloping the function for either scenario appropriately.

The function as it is written right now, satifies Scenario 2
