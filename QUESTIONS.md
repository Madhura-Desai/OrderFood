**The ambiguity in the acceptance criteria can be explained using the example given S = 5, M=3, L 7, Remaining Food =17lbs**

**Case 1**: The minimum food here is 5 *10 +3 *20 +7*30 = 320. Is the objective function to keep the 
 	Stock level at 320 * 1.2??   In this case, order quantity = (320 * 1.2) – 17 = 367lbs

**Case2**: Is the objective to order 20% more than the difference between (320 – 17) *1.2 = 363.6lbs?? Reasons might be some food package is lost or some food comes spoiled in the package
